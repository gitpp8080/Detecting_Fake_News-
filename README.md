# Detecting_Fake_News
In this Python project, we'll use the 'news.csv' dataset containing news articles labeled as REAL or FAKE. Our approach involves transforming the text data into numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer, then training a PassiveAggressive Classifier for binary classification. After training, we'll evaluate the model's accuracy and examine the confusion matrix to gauge its effectiveness in accurately identifying real and fake news. This project aims to build a reliable model for news classification.
